Fun hack to turn text to gif. 

It works by:

1. Turning the input text to a PNG
2. Reading the PNG and getting the coordinates of the text's pixels
3. Clustering the pixels to form letters
4. Adding time element for the animation
5. Plotting the coordinates add adding noise
6. Adding animation

Created due to impractical reason (i.e. I don't want to take a video of myself saying "come to Wes!")

Here's a sample
